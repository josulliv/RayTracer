The sphereflake is an object consisting of a single large sphere with 9
smaller spheres attached to its surface, each of which have 9 smaller
spheres attached to their surfaces, etc., five levels deep.

Six of the spheres are mounted at 60 degree intervals around the parent
sphere's equator.  The other three are distributed evenly around the
"top" hemisphere.  The bottom hemisphere of each sphere is empty, since
that is where it's attached to its base.

Start with the radius "ra", the center "center", & the up direction
"direction". First, compute the vector pointing to heading 000.  This
vector is in a plane containing "center" and perpendicular to
"direction".  This vector points to the first equatorial sphere.
Compute the first sphere.  Next, offset the vector 60 degrees from
heading 000, still in the same plane.  Compute the next sphere.
Continue through to sphere 6.



Parent sphere: ra = 512, center = 0,0,0, direction = 0,1,0 (up).
